UNDERSTANDING BUSINESS NEED

The customer journey was mapped to understand their experience from â€¨end-to-end
Through this we were able to define what the ideal customer experience looks like
Establishing As-Is customer experience
We were then also able to implement a GAP analysis to prioritise necessary tasks going forward to optimise the journey

THE PURCHASE EXPERIENCE

We transformed the website from a corporate page with a shop attached, to a high converting e-commerce site
This optimised customer flow, ease of use, with flexibility built into WordPress with Woo Commerce

DISTRIBUTOR PORTAL

We created a distributor portal which allows distributors to manage their Fuel3D accounts through a number of useful features including; 

* Place bulk orders with personalised discount applied 
* Provide feedback on the product and access support materials to serve customers better 
* Direct access to marketing materials including video guides, image galleries and FAQs

Working with the B2B team Matter understood the varied and complex requirements for Distributor purchases and turned detailed manual elements into a single point of self service for the re-ordering of products and past order information. Learnings showed that multiples and quick ordering were important architectural elements 

As part of the automation of the relationship between Fuel3D and their distributors the team worked to create a live home for the latest information and timeline of interactions to be held so that distributors could have easy access to their relationship at a time to suit them.

Part of the relationship with fuel3D and their distributors was ensuring that they all had the latest information when they needed it. As a result we automated a link into the portal for all of the latest information to be synced into the distributor timelines giving a uniformed approach to marketing materials and product updates.

Register their scanner and create a new account
Access and manage their account details, visit the forum and be targeted with recommended products.

Quick buy links for recommended product specific to individual needs
Access to previous order history, invoices and renewals
