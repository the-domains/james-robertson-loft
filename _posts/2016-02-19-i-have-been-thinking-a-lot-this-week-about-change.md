# I have been thinking a lot this week about change!

But not just change for change sake, really important changes that are not planned and don't have the luxury of time and structure. 

What do we do if we have a truly needed change that is also truly immediate? 

Do we use the organisational crow bar and jam it in all along saying we knew it was coming or do we hold our hands up high and say "look this is new, it's coming fast but it will make things better".

Obviously some changes are complex and indeed negative for some but not others and some are grounded in regulation and legalities but beyond that once the right creative and positive message has been struck the rest should be a fait a complit to those receiving the change? Right? 

Well I guess I think the answer is yes and no (with roughly a million more questions I think) 
Do you actually need to convince those who receive a message or are they tiered of messages and just resign themselves to change? If so do you need to convince the people who accept changes on their behalf? And to what extent do they understand the people? There in lies another question! What if the structured processes for delivering change are the aspects slowing it down. 

With the hat on now of someone who's job it has been to makes large changes in big and small organisation I have worked in both of these environments. Somewhere I have been standing in front of someone genuinely trying to explain why what is going on is about to improve their quality of life. And the other when I have been sitting in a boardroom talking to the people who represent the 'Heads' that will be affected. 

My overall feeling on this is that the size of the organisation or who is asked to give the message is all too late by this point for a smooth transition or interaction around a change. Building a vision of the improvement should be an early (and honest if there is going to be people changes) message that starts a journey, the people effected need to feel they are coming on it with you, therefore either the people themselves or those represented need to have the engagement and interaction that allows empowerment of the situation. 

If the change is quick then there is an argument to say it is being dealt with too late, anyone who has worked in large organisations knows that is an irrelevant point as it is going to still happen.

You will never stop the old 'and brutal' activities that still take place of telling everyone on a Friday that they only have two more weeks left while the unions are approached after working somewhere for twenty years but even in a short time a good change manager can make a difference.
