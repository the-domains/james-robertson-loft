# You can't make a fish climb a tree.

Dyslexia and the role it pays in peoples lives and in the educational system has for a long time been a topic of interest with many people. I agree whole heartedly with the belief that our current system of education is outdated in the way it teaches young people and in particular how it spends time using techniques that are not useful to people who are dyslexic.
I remember my school years very well. It did't take them very long to label me as lazy and lacking attention. I remember being 14 and being told that I would never amount to anything, fortunately they got it wrong. While there were many who were quick to dismiss me, there were teachers and people on my journey I will always appreciate for believeing in me, however they were neither supported or equipped enough to a degree that could enable them to help me.
Thankfully it got easier when I discovered a point where I was able to reason my thinking rather than accepting the orders to sit quietly and follow the rules. Not everyone is always as fortunate as me as they don't reach that point and are made to feel they aren't worth anything because they struggle to pass exams.

For the first time, in recent years, I can start to see movement in the way the world works. Fish like me are receiving the support and social acceptance we need to swim freely, instead of being forced to prove our worth by wasting energy climbing trees.
Businesses are finally starting to tune in to a fundamental message; products, services and experiences built by, designed around, or managed by those in the world who know their way around a spreadsheet or 20,000 word plan written in a perfectly formatted style are not necessarily the people who make the company stand out and be noticed. If anything, they are too dull! Now I'm not saying dyslexic people are typically better, but more that they see the world in very different ways. Rather than tell you that the bottom line figure is Â£2,894.60 or recite the intricacies of management theory on the topic of staff resource levelling, they are more likely to show you from a completely different perspective how the workings of your operation fit together or how your brand appears to a wider audience than you have been able to focus on so far.
There is speculation that anywhere up to 60% of the people in America who refer to themselves as Entrepreneurs are dyslexic. This leads me to the key thought that there is no connection between someones ability to spell and innovating any better than anyone else in a room. In fact being dyslexic may even help you do it.
So what does this changing horizon mean? Will dyslexics rule the world? Will there be an uprising? If you go by the fact that I just had to look up how to spell militia then we would certainly be the less organised of armies and our propaganda will be in picture form.
Instead of all out war, I believe there will be a change in the way people and businesses communicate, playing into the skill sets of dyslexic people. I believe written skills will decline and creative skills will become the elements that start to be truly value adding. What do I mean by that? Well, for starters people who can can communicate to the world through drawing are more quickly understood; people who can stand up and share an allegory of why something is best can be better heard; and those who have the ability to express themselves visually will are seen by more. All of those are skills that are aligned and at many times skewed in the direction of dyslexics. They also play amazingly into the ways technology has and is changing how we share information.
So why entrepreneurship? Again I think being dyslexic sets people up in a way of life that helps with this! Perhaps this is a by-product of the school system as well. Creativity comes from the grey area where there often isn't someone telling you what to do. People who have spent their lives in a slightly separate space, where they haven't fit the mould and actively run in the other direction when people have told them to sit still and read, have by their very approach to life learnt alternative ways of getting by. Mine was talking. To this day I can stand and speak for an hour and be heard and understood. To then turn to a keyboard and show that knowledge as a written medium on the other hand? I would never do my words justice.
Richard Branson once said in an interview about being dyslexic "a company is a product that makes a difference to other peoples' lives -- it doesn't matter how you get to that point." That is the vital element here I think of why entrepreneurship is such a home for innovators who are dyslexic. Partly because you make your own rules up as to the what and how of your work, but also because of that "making it happen" element of the way our minds work. Fixing and completing compared to refining and perfecting allow for the timescales to fit the mindset and for these innovators to get things to customers, learn and adapt as they always have.
